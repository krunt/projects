So that peers may easily determine their IP address.  A BitTorrent
tracker may return the requesting peer's public IP address.


Overview
========

A BitTorrent client can easily learn the IP address used when sending,
but because of intervnening Network Address Translators (NATs) the IP
address of the client's host seen inside the client's private network
may differ from the IP address used to route the client's packets
through the public Internet.

In BitTorrent as described in BEP 3 [#BEP-3]_, peers wishing to
transfer a file contact a central tracker.  This tracker returns a
list of peers that are currently transferring the file.  For all peers
that reach the tracker across the public Internet, the source address
in each request seen by the tracker carries the publicly routable IP
address of the requesting peer.

A tracker implementing this extension returns the key *external ip*
with a bencoded string value containing the IPv4 address as a 32 bit
binary or containing the IPv6 address as a 128 bit binary.  

Using a 32 or 128 packed binary is idiosyncratic since the value for
the *ip* key returned in a dict within the *peers* list is returned as
a string using ipv4 dotted notation or a domain name.  However the
packed representation poses no semantic disadvantage and is negligibly
smaller.

The IPv4 part of this extension has been supported by uTorrent since
May of 2007.

The tracker is not unique in its ability to see a peer's public IP
address.  Any peer reached over the public Internet sees the public IP
address of the peer on the far side of the connection.  The *Extension
Protocol* proposed in [#BEP-10]_ provides a mechanism for a client to
obtains its public IP from any of its peers.  There is no conflict for
a BitTorrent client to support both tracker and peer methods, and they
have slightly different advantages.  A peer can learn its external IP
from a tracker even when there are no peers.  For trackerless swarms,
a peer can learn its IP from any peer whose reference was obtained from the DHT
[#BEP-5]_.
