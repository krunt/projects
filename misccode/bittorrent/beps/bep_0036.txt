Abstract
========

It has become common practice to publish RSS feeds linking to content by using torrent files. This BEP attempts to document and standardize how to format such RSS feeds.

Terminology
===========

For the purpose of the BEP, the term torrent link will be used to identify any kind of URL
identifying a torrent. This may be either an HTTP or HTTPS URL pointing to a .torrent file or
a `magnet link`_ identifying a torrent info-hash.

.. _`magnet link`: bep0009.html

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
`RFC 2119`_.

.. _`RFC 2119`: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt

Client support
==============

This section will document which RSS formats currently are supported by bittorrent clients.

+-----------------------------+---------+--------+

RSS 2.0 are feeds based on the rss/channel/item tags.

Atom are feeds based on the feed/entry tags.

The following table indicates which tags are supported for *items* in a feed. Only tags
that identify the torrent are included, since those are the key tags. The ``ttl`` tag is
used by the server to indicate how frequently subscribers should refresh the feed.

By far the most well supported format for feeds among bittorrent clients are *RSS* (as opposed to Atom)
and the ``enclosure`` tag for torrent content.

enclosure
---------

The enclosure tag MUST have a ``type`` attribute set to "application/x-bittorrent" and
MUST store the torrent link in a ``url`` attribute. It MAY have a ``length`` attribute,
which should indicate the size of the .torrent file, in bytes.

Example::

	<enclosure type="application/x-bittorrent" length="12216" url="http://featuredcontent.utorrent.com/torrents/WillisEarlBeal-BitTorrent.torrent"/>

media:content
-------------

The media content tag is really the "content" tag under the namespace ``http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/``. Most bittorrent
clients don't support XML namespaces in their generic form. Most clients that support the ``media:content`` tag
assume that the namespace is called ``media`` in the feed, and will not recognize the tag otherwise.

For more information see `the media RSS specification`_.

.. _`the media RSS specification`: http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/

The ``media::content`` tag includes metadata as attributes. The ones relevant to bittorrent clients are
``url`` which is the torrent link, and ``filesize`` which is the size of the torrent's content (in bytes).

Example::

	<media:content url="http://featuredcontent.utorrent.com/torrents/WillisEarlBeal-BitTorrent.torrent" fileSize="12216320"/>

media:hash
----------

The media hash tag provides the info hash of the torrent hex encoded.

Example::

	<media:hash algo="sha1"><8c056e06fbc16d2a2be79cefbf3e4ddc15396abe/media:hash>


link
----

The link tag contains the torrent link as its body.

Example::

	<link>http://featuredcontent.utorrent.com/torrents/WillisEarlBeal-BitTorrent.torrent</link>

torrent
-------

The torrent tag can be used instead of magnet links or to complement another tag which has
a torrent link in it. The torrent tag only provides two attributes, ``infohash`` and
``contentlength``, which are supposed to be the hex encoded info-hash of the torrent and
the size of the torrent's content respectively.

Although uTorrent doesn't support any other tags, ``magneturi`` and ``filename`` typically
occur in this tag, containing the magnet link and name of the torrent respectively

Example::

	<torrent>
		<infohash>"8c056e06fbc16d2a2be79cefbf3e4ddc15396abe</infohash>
		<contentlength>600162597</contentlength>
	</torrent>

For more information, see the xmlns_.

.. _xmlns: http://xmlns.ezrss.it/0.1/

guid
----

Sometimes the torrent link is encoded as the GUID in RSS feeds.

Example::

	<guid>http://featuredcontent.utorrent.com/torrents/WillisEarlBeal-BitTorrent.torrent</guid>

However, for the most part, clients expect the GUID to simply be a unique
identifier for this piece of content and is only used to avoid downloading
duplicates. uTorrent is an exception in that it also looks for torrent links
in the guid tag.

conclusions
-----------

Even though this section may look like a comparison of clients, its main
point is that there are currently a very large number of ways of representing
torrents in RSS feeds, and clients support some and not others.

The main take away from the client support is that there is a distinct need for
a standardization document like this, to make torrent RSS feeds less of a black
art, and to provide clear recommendations for torrent feed providers.

Torrent RSS feeds
=================

The proposed standard RSS feed format for torrents is an RSS 2.0 feed using
the ``enclosure`` tag for torrent content.

The ``ttl`` tag SHOULD be supported and honored. The definition of the value
inside the ``ttl`` tag is the number of seconds to wait until the client should refresh
the feed the next time.

The ``enclosure`` tag MUST include a ``type`` attribute set to ``application/x-bittorrent``
and MUST include a ``url`` attribute containing the torrent link.

If an ``enclosure`` tag matching the above mentioned specifications, it SHOULD take priority
over any other tag found in the RSS ``item``.

The ``title`` tag SHOULD be used for the name of the torrent.

The ``description`` tag MAY be used for a description of the content. If a ``description`` tag
is available, it SHOULD NOT contain any markup. It should be plain text.

Clients often need to identify whether a torrent has already been downloaded or not just
by inspecting the ``item``. For this reason, RSS feeds SHOULD include a ``guid`` field.
If practical, the ``guid`` SHOULD be the info-hash of the torrent. That way, GUIDs
would match across different feeds.

Example:

.. parsed-literal::

	**<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>**
	**<rss version="2.0">**
		**<channel>**
			**<title>** Featured content **</title>**
			**<link>** http://featuredcontent.utorrent.com/ **</link>**
			**<item>**
				**<title>** WillisEarlBeal-BitTorrent **</title>**
				**<description>**
					The Principles of a Protagonist Bundle

					Chicago native Willis Earl Beal came from humble musical beginnings- he
					began as a street performer of sorts that was prone to leaving homemade
					novels, artwork and CD-Rs across America to promote his work, suggesting
					a desire to be heard. Thereafter, he relocated to Albuquerque, NM where
					he continued his practice of 'gifting' as he simultaneously recorded a
					set of songs on a discarded karaoke machine that would become Acousmatic
					Sorcery, his Hot Charity/XL Recordings debut.
				**</description>**
				**<guid>** e380a6c5ae0fb15f296d29964a56250780b05ad7 **</guid>**
				**<enclosure
					url="http://featuredcontent.utorrent.com/torrents/WillisEarlBeal-BitTorrent.torrent"
					type="application/x-bittorrent" />**
			**</item>**
		**</channel>**
	**</rss>**

extended torrent attributes
---------------------------

For torrent sites providing listings of torrents along with more detailed statistics,
the recommended tags are the ones defined by eztv_.

Example:

.. parsed-literal::

	**<torrent>**
		**<filename>** WillisEarlBeal-BitTorrent **</filename>**
		**<contentlength>** 28571661 **</contentlength>**
		**<magneturi>** magnet:?xt=urn:btih:e380a6c5ae0fb15f296d29964a56250780b05ad7&dn=WillisEarlBean **</magneturi>**
