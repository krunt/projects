Post-History:

This extends the tracker protocol to support simple obfuscation of the
peers it returns, using the infohash as a shared secret between the
peer and the tracker. The obfuscation does not provide any security
against eavesdroppers that know the infohash of the torrent.  The goal
is to prevent internet service providers and other network
administrators from blocking or disrupting bittorrent traffic
connections that span between the receiver of a tracker response and
any peer IP-port appearing in that tracker response.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are
to be interpreted as described in IETF `RFC 2119`_. 


Announce
========

When using this extension, instead of passing the ``info_hash`` parameter
to the tracker, a ``sha_ih`` is passed.

The value of ``sha_ih`` MUST be the info-hash of the torrent, with a second
SHA-1 applied to it.

For example if a torrent has infohash with hex representation
``aaf4c61ddcc5e8a2dabedef3b482cd9aea9434d`` then its ``sha_ih`` is
``sha1(infohash)='6b4f89a54e2d27ecd7e8da5b4ab8fd9d1d8b119'``.

The value MUST be url encoded, just like the ``info_hash``.  Thus the
``sha_ih`` above when url encoded becomes
``kO%89%A5N-%27%EC%D7%E8%DA%05%B4%AB%8F%D9%D1%D8%B1%19``.

If the ``sha_ih`` is passed then the value for the ``port`` parameter
should be treated as a 16 bit integer and MUST be obscured as
described in the `Obfuscation Method`_ section.  Similarly if the
optional ``ip`` parameter is passed in the announce then its value
MUST also be so obscured.

This extension does not change the semantics of any parameter passed
in the peer's announce.

Announce Response
=================

If the tracker supports this extension, the response should be exactly
the same as if the ``info_hash`` had been passed, except that any
field that contains peer information (such as ``peers``, ``peers6`` or
any other field defined by another extension) MUST be obfuscated as
described in the next section.

There are additional parameters the tracker may OPTIONALLY return.
These are discussed in the optimizations_ section.

Obfuscation Method
==================

The values for the ``ip`` and ``port`` announce parameters, the
*returned peer list* and any other values that contain peer
information are obscured using the method described in this section.

We distinguish between the *tracker peer list* and the *returned peer
list*.  The *tracker peer list* contains the ip-port pairs of all
known peers in a given torrent, i.e., those peers that have reported
to the tracker that they are transferring the file with a given
infohash.  The tracker may store this peer list however it wishes.
The *returned peer list* contains a packed array of ip-port pairs
conforming to the BitTorrent protocol specification.  If the swarm is
sufficiently large then the returned ip-port pairs constitute a subset
of the ip-port pairs in the *tracker peer list*.

When a parameter is obscured, it is encrypted using RC4-drop768
encryption using the infohash as a shared secret and optionally
employing an initialization vector.  

For the remainder of this document RC4 refers to RC4-drop768.  In the
process of encryption, RC4 generates a pseudorandom string that is
XOR'd with the plaintext to generate the ciphertext.  The receiver
recovers the plaintext by generating the same pseudorandom string and
XOR'ing it with the ciphertext.  In generating the pseudorandom
string, the tracker and client MUST discard the first 768 bytes.  The
next 8 bytes in the pseudorandom string are reserved for optimizations
discussed in the next section.

To communicate an initialization vector, the tracker includes in the
bencoded response the parameter ``iv`` with value set to a byte string
containing the initialization vector.  The initialization vector can
be of arbitrary length and is sent in plaintext.  Initialization
vectors can only be applied to parameters in tracker responses and NOT
to announces.

If the tracker sends no initialization vector then the infohash is
used as the RC4 key (160 bit key).  If the tracker provides an
initialization vector then the RC4 key is generated by appending the
vector to the infohash and then hashing with SHA-1.  The resulting
hash is then used as the RC4 key.  

For example, given infohash ``aaf4c61ddcc5e8a2dabedef3b482cd9aea9434d``
and initialization vector ``abcd`` both represented in hex, the RC4 key
is derived as follows:

::
 
   key = sha1( 'aaf4c61ddcc5e8a2dabedef3b482cd9aea9434dabcd' )

The resulting key in hex is ``f36e9cae87cf33e07645ef5ca745a8a83469f31e``.

It is RECOMMENDED that the tracker use the initialization vector, and
that it change the ``iv`` on roughly the same period as the rerequest
interval.  The reasoning for this is contained in the rationale.


Optimizations
=============

The described optimizations are OPTIONAL for the tracker, but the
corresponding client-side MUST be implemented by clients that support
this extension.  These optimizations hobble the strength of the RC4
encryption in order to improve tracker performance.  In the rationale_
section we discuss why hobbling RC4 is reasonable and in many cases
has negligible foreseen effect on security.

For the purpose of these optimizations we assume that the tracker
stores the tracker peer list for each infohash as a packed array that
can be copied directly into the response.  We further assume that the
packed array is reused many times and that with each request the
tracker either returns the entire packed array or copies a single
contiguous substring from the tracker peer list into the response.

If the peerlist is represented and used as assumed then to improve
randomness in the set of peers handed out by the tracker, it is
RECOMMENDED that the tracker periodically reshuffle the peerlist with
period similar to the rerequest interval.  After each reshuffle the
tracker reperforms the operations described in this section.

To reduce computation the tracker MAY cache the pseudorandom string
generated by RC4 and reuse it as peers arrive and depart.

The tracker MAY also cache the encrypted tracker peer list.  To
support this the tracker MUST pass two additional parameters *i* and *n*
each with 32-bit integer values, except the tracker MAY omit *i* and
*n* when *i=0* and the *returned peer list* is the entire *tracker peer
list*.  Whether the tracker returns *i* and *n*, the first 8 bytes of
the RC4 psuedorandom string are reserved for obscuring *i* and *n*.
We come back to this momentarily.  Decryption starts by XORing from
*6i* bytes for ipv4 (or *18i* for ipv6) into the pseudorandom string
after the discarded and reserved bytes.  Assuming that the tracker
encrypted the tracker peer list starting from the first byte after the
discarded and reserved bytes in the pseudorandom string then *i* also
corresponds to the *ith* ip-port pair in the tracker peer list.

So that the client and the tracker do not have to generate an
arbitrarily long pseudorandom string to support large swarms, we
assume the tracker bounds the length of the pseudorandom string and
reports the length in ip-port pairs as the value to parameter *n*.  *n*
excludes reserved and discarded bytes.  We RECOMMEND that *n* be equal
to the length of the tracker peer list or random but within constant
factor of the longest peerlist returned by the tracker, whichever is
smaller.  Thus the tracker encrypts the *jth* byte of the *ith*
ip-port pair in an ipv4 tracker peer list by XORing with the byte
*(6i+j)* `mod` *n* bytes into the pseudorandom string.

Transmitting *i* and *n* as plaintext would significantly reduce the
cost for an attacker to recover the pseudorandom string.  The tracker
MUST XOR the value of *i* with the first 32 bits of the pseudorandom
string.  The tracker then XORs *n* with the next 32 bits from the
pseudorandom string (see Figure 1).

.. figure:: bep_0008_pseudo.png

   **Figure 1:** The first 768 bytes of the RC4 pseudorandom
   string are discarded.  The parameter *i* in the tracker response has
   value ``x xor i``.  The parameter *n* has value ``y xor n``.

We describe encryption in the following example for an ipv4 tracker peer 
list consisting of 3 ip-port pairs, and using an RC4 pseudorandom string 
of length *n=2*. *n* is small for purposes of illustration.  Also, for the 
purpose of illustration, the tracker returns only 2 peers at a time.

::

  Given the following peer list
  (208.72.193.86, 6881), (209.81.173.15,14321), (128.213.6.8, 6881)

  As a packed array represented in hex it becomes
               
  d048c1561ae1d151ad0f37f180d506081ae1 

  which we XOR with an RC4 pseudorandom string excluding discarded and
  reserved bytes, e.g.,

  a496e5f9b83e835013d42226

  to generate 

  74de24afa2df5201bedb15d72443e3f1a2df

Because the RC4 pseudorandom string is shorter than the tracker
peer list, we wrap to the beginning of the pseudorandom string.

A tracker returning the first two peers would return the bencoded
equivalent of::

  peers=74de24afa2df5201bedb15d7, i=0, n=2

A tracker returning the second and third peer would return the
bencoded equivalent of::

  peers=5201bedb15d72443e3f1a2df, i=1, n=2

In each response the tracker includes additional parameters such as
the rerequest ``interval`` and the initialization vector ``iv``.

The tracker response MUST remain a valid bencoded message.


Backwards Compatibility
=======================

Trackers that support obfuscation are identified in the .torrent file
by the inclusion of an ``obfuscate-announce-list`` which otherwise has the 
same semantics as the ``announce-list`` parameter.  Peers that do not support
obfuscation simply ignore the ``obfuscate-announce-list``.  

A client that is configured to use this extension should always send
the ``sha_ih`` to any tracker supporting obfuscation.  The client
SHOULD only contact trackers in the ``announce-list`` once the client
has attempted all trackers in the ``obfuscate-announce-list`` and all failed. 

If a tracker that supports obfuscation wishes to allow legacy peers to
connect to the tracker then the announce URL should appear in both the
``obfuscate-announce-list`` and the ``announce-list``.

If a tracker URL appears in both lists running on the same port, and
the tracker failed to respond when selected from the
``obfuscate-announce-list`` then the client MAY treat the tracker in
the ``announce-list`` as if it were temporarily unreachable and defer
trying it until it has tried other trackers in the ``announce-list``.

Peers MUST never send both the ``info_hash`` and ``sha_ih`` parameters
in the same request, since that would defeat the purpose of the shared
secret.

Any peer that requests with a ``sha_ih`` SHOULD implement Message
Stream Encryption (MSE) [#MSE]_.  Any peer returned from the tracker
in response to a request with a ``sha_ih`` SHOULD be assumed to
support Message Stream Encryption.  We include these provisions
because if a peer communicates with another peer without using MSE
then the BitTorrent protocol is trivially identified from the first
twenty bytes of the BitTorrent header and the ``info_hash`` appears in
plaintext as the next twenty bytes, hence also defeating the purpose
of the shared secret.

If the tracker does not know enough peers assumed to support MSE to
return the desired number of peers then it MAY include peers that are
not assumed to support MSE.  If a peer closes a connection in response
to an encrypted header then the initiating peer SHOULD assume that the
peer does not support MSE.  The initiating peer however SHOULD ONLY
initiate unencrypted connections when all peers have been tried and
those that support MSE fail to provide "adequate performance."  We
intentionally omit any definition of "adequate performance."


Rationale
=========

This extension directly addresses a known attack on the BitTorrent
protocol performed by some deployed network hardware.  By obscuring
the ip-port pairs network hardware can no longer easily identify
ip-port pairs that are running BitTorrent by observing peer-to-tracker
communications.  This deployed hardware under some conditions disrupts
BitTorrent connections by injecting forged TCP reset packets.  

This hardware was presumably deployed to get around BitTorrent
Message Stream Encryption [#MSE]_.  Peers implementing BitTorrent Message Stream
Encryption obfuscate peer-to-peer connections by employing RC4
encryption on every byte from the first byte transferred. BitTorrent
Message Stream Encryption thus increases the difficulty for a device
observing passing packets to identify BitTorrent peer-to-peer
connections.

By using the SHA-1 of the infohash, the tracker is able to identify
torrents without sending the plaintext infohash and without requiring
an additional prior exchange of a shared secret.  Where trackers now
maintain mappings from infohash to the corresponding torrent's
peerlist and other torrent-specific state, obfuscated trackers would
need one additional mapping from ``sha_ih`` to the torrent's state.
Trackers may also cache the encrypted version of each torrent's
tracker peer list, to increase computational performance at the
expense of increasing memory footprint by a constant factor.

The obfuscation method meets the following criteria:

- The entire plaintext of the peer list is not easily obtained even if
  an eavesdropper identifies one or more subsequent connections as
  using BitTorrent and the corresponding ip-port pairs appeared in the
  ciphertext of the tracker response.

- Even when a subsequent connection from a peer that has received a 
  tracker response is observed by an eavesdropper, it is difficult to 
  map the ip-port pair to specific ciphertext to verify that the
  connection is using BitTorrent.

When the optimizations_ are used,
 
- Few computations are performed at request time. 

- Encryption may be performed at the time a peer is added.
  The encrypted peer ip and port may be handed out hundreds of times.

- Security is minimally impacted.

The objective is NOT to create a cryptographically secure protocol
that can survive unlimited observation of passing packets and
substantial computational resources on network timescales.  The objective
is to raise the bar sufficiently to deter attacks based on observing
ip-port numbers in peer-to-tracker communications.

If a tracker observes a large number of tracker requests and responses
and subsequent connections, it is possible to attack the encryption.
RC4 is known to have a number of weaknesses especially in the way it
is used with WEP [#Borisov]_ [#Scott]_ [#Stubblefeld]_.  However, with
tracker peer obfuscation, the number of bytes transferred between the
tracker and a client is likely significantly smaller than transferred
between a wireless computer and a basestation.  An attacker faces a
much larger task in obtaining sufficient ciphertext to directly break
the encryption.

Hobbling the RC4 encryption by using a bounded-length RC4 pseudorandom
string for small swarms is likely to have negilgible impact on
security over any other encyption method since the pseudorandom string
is probably equal to or longer than the plaintext and thus no part of
it is repeated in the XOR except as peers arrive or leave the swarm.
Thus on the timescales of rerequest intervals, nearly the same
ciphertext is handed to every peer requesting the same infohash.
Intercepting the same ciphertext multiple times provides no additional
information to the attacker.  The attacker could correlate ip-port
pairs in connections following tracker responses, but an attacker
could do this regardless of the encryption method employed.
Furthermore more direct methods of traffic analysis applied to
peer-to-peer communication is available to network operators.

For larger swarms, hobbling RC4 may simplify breaking the encryption
since the same pseudorandom string is used repeatedly across the peer
list.  Some study is in order taking into account that the tracker can
periodically change intiailization vectors.

We know from experience that periodically reshuffling peer lists on
the order of the rerequest interval negligibly impacts tracker
performance even with swarms containing millions of peers.  Generating
a new pseudorandom string using RC4 on this same time interval is
likely to incur negligible performance penalty because 1) RC4 is a
small constant factor more expensive than a shuffle on an input string
of equal length, 2) the generated pseudorandom string is only *n*
ip-port pairs long where recommended *n* is within a small constant
factor larger than the largest *returned peer list* and thus much
smaller than the *tracker peer list* for large swarms, and 3) the cost
of the XOR operation is lighter weight than performing a random
shuffle.
